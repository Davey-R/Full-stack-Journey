# Full-stack-Journey
The slow growth of my Journey as a developer from beginning till end of my life time.

There are no instructions to this repository, this is my personal repository for my personal viewing and a way to present my profile to others.
  Even though it has no specific target audience, I do wish people who are looking to hire, people who want to collaborate, people who want to see the journey of a 
  developer went through will find it helpful. -Dave Rao
